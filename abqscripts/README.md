# ABAQUS Scripts

These are the ABAQUS scripts required to run the finite difference simulations. There are four different simulations (AFM, Hemisphere, Wave, Axisymmetric); simulations implement ABAQUS (2017) software for quasi-static, implicit computations using user subroutines UMAT. Samples are modelled as continuous, homogeneous and isotropic elastic materials with Young's modulus and Poisson ratio comparable to biomolecules. To eliminate the hourglass effect, R3D10 tetrahedral elements are employed.  Simulations impliment "surface to surface contact" interaction with "hard", nonadhesive normal contact and "rough" (Coulomb friction), non-slip tangential contact. Boundary conditions fix the base of the structures, and vertical force and indentation data are mapped and sampled via reference points at the indenter's centre.
