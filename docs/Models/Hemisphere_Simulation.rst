abqsims.hemisphere is the python based interface to produce hemisphere simulations and has various composite functions. To establish how AFM measures the topography and nanomechanics of simple geometries, we probed imaging of elastic hemispheres. Simulations focused on the perceived compression of the structure's central scanline. The spherical/cylindrical structures model the two-dimensional compression of DNA imaging along the transverse axis The hemisphere is modelled as a three-dimensional elastic part in ABAQUS with a fixed, rigid base beneath. Unlike the indentation of a full sphere with a single contact point at the base, the fixed base of a hemisphere alleviates the compression of the surface.
