abqsims.wave is the python based interface to produce wave simulations and has various composite functions. AFM resolution is commonly indicated by reference to structures that are at least locally periodic, for example, in atomic resolution mapping at a solid-liquid interface, in identification of recurrent features in a two-dimensional lattice of membrane proteins, or the distinction of the two strands of the double helix along a DNA molecule. Therefore, we considered AFM measurements on a periodic soft material where simulations focused on the compression produced from a single scan along the centre axis of the structures. As shown above, the structure has a wavelength $\lambda = 10nm$ and amplitude, $A_{Sample} = 10nm $.
