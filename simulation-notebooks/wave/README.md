AFM resolution is commonly indicated by reference to structures that are at least locally periodic, for example, in atomic resolution mapping at a solid-liquid interface, in identification of recurrent features in a two-dimensional lattice of membrane proteins, or the distinction of the two strands of the double helix along a DNA molecule. Therefore, we considered AFM measurements on a periodic soft material where simulations focused on the compression produced from a single scan along the centre axis of the structures. As shown above, the structure has a wavelength $\lambda = 10nm$ and amplitude, $A_{Sample} = 10nm $.
